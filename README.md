# Audio Generation Showcase

This repository hosts a website showcasing the results of various audio generation models. The project demonstrates the capabilities of different architectures in generating instrumental tracks from vocal inputs.

## 🎵 Models Showcased

1. **Independent GPT-2 Model (Standardized Less)**
2. **Independent GPT-2 Model (Standardized Full)**
3. **Joint Model (Standardized Full)**
4. **Cross Attention Model (Standardized Full)**

## 🎼 Structure for Each Model

Each model section contains three inferences, and each inference includes:

### Input
- Vocal
- Reference Beat

### Generated Tracks (in order)
1. Hi-Hat
2. Kick
3. Snare
4. Clap
5. Bass
6. Drums
7. Keys
8. Full Instrumental
